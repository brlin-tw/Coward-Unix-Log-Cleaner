# Coward Unix Log Cleaner

<https://github.com/Lin-Buo-Ren/Coward-Unix-Log-Cleaner>

This cleaner is so coward that it only removes rotated log files, truncates(empties) all _obvious_ log files left, and nothing more.

This is useful for someone doesn't fully trust those powerful "X Cleaner" applications but still want to save some disk space, without the possiblity of breaking something.

## Warnings

- Don't use this utility in production systems as it will make system breach investigation difficult
- This utility doesn't clear non-obvious log files, for your privacy and other sakes you may want to check out the leftovers
